Chef Server Install Cookbook
This is a cookbook that attempts to install a Chef Server.
For training purposes, it will pattern itself after Chef's own Chef Server cookbook.

The goal is to learn how to bootstrap a Linux server with the required 
packages, configure necessary files, and start up the Chef Server.

Due to the high complexity of this cookbook, it is ideal to start with since it will include many areas
required to become proficient at Chef.
